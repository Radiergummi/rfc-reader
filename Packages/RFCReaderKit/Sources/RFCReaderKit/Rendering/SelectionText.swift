/// What a copied selection puts on the pasteboard.
///
/// A selection is rebuilt rather than transcribed, because the reader's text and the
/// reader's drawing do not carry the same information. A reference is drawn as a
/// chip: a leading symbol, then the label with its brackets taken off, because the
/// chip's tint is what separates it from the words either side. Transcribing those
/// characters gives two things nobody wants on a pasteboard:
///
///   - `U+FFFC`, the object-replacement character carrying the chip's symbol, which
///     is meaningless outside the text view, plus the `U+2060` word joiner behind it;
///   - no delimiters, so two adjacent references run together — `see RFC 9110 RFC
///     9111` — which is the exact ambiguity the brackets were there to prevent.
///
/// Every reference run is therefore replaced by `CrossReference.label`: the plain
/// form the model already composes for precisely this, brackets included, and the
/// same string `RFCXMLSerializer` writes out. The screen shows `display.text`; the
/// pasteboard gets `label`. One model, two renderings, neither guessing at the other.
